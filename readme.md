This site is deployed using Nodejs. I use Express and AngularJS to manage routing/http calls along with making it a SPA (Single Page Application)

Can test locally simply by running node command on index.js file.

*Note to myself: for GET use req.query(path) or req.param(:param), for post use req.body
